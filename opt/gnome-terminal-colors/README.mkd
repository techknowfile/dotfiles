Colorschemes for Gnome Terminal
========================================

Scripts for setting various colorschemes with Gnome Terminal. To get nicely
colored directory listings, you will also need to set up a [dircolors solarised
color theme].

For Mate Terminal, you can use [mate-terminal-colors-solarized], maintained
by @cledoux.

Installation and usage
----------------------

To be able to uninstall, we highly recommend that you create a new Gnome
Terminal profile, using the menus in Gnome Terminal (File... New Profile).

You need the `dconf` command (if you run a recent Gnome version). With Ubuntu,
this can be installed by running

    $ sudo apt-get install dconf-cli

Then clone the repository and you can run the installation script:

    $ git clone https://github.com/metalelf0/gnome-terminal-colors.git
    $ cd gnome-terminal-colors-solarized
    $ ./install.sh

And just follow the instructions.

To run this script remotely or via cron (or from any shell where
`DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` is not set), you need to start a dbus connection:

    $ dbus-launch ./install.sh

Uninstall
---------

Change to another profile in Gnome Terminal, then remove the Solarized profile
by running:

### Gnome 3.6 or lower

    $ rm -r ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Solarized/
    $ gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/gnome-terminal

### Gnome 3.8 or higher

Be sure to have the dconf-cli package installed and do:

    $ dconf reset -f /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/PROFILE_ID"

Replace PROFILE_ID by your profile ID (you can get it in your profile
configuration in gnome-terminal).

Themes
------

Each theme has is own folder in the `colors` dir. It contains the following
files:

  * bd_color: bold color
  * bg_color: background color
  * fg_color: foreground color
  * palette: list of colors for all standard color codes.

No additional configuration is needed to add a theme, the installation script
just list at launch the children folders in the `colors` dir.

Dircolors
---------

The installation script will ask if a solarized dircolors is wanted. It will be
downloaded and installed as `~/.dir_colors/dircolors`. On CentOS, it can be an
issue (see issue #62), as the default setup use `~/.dir_colors` as dircolors.
In that case, you should manually move `~/.dir_colors` as
`~/.dir_colors/dircolors` before starting the installation script.

If the dircolors is not applied, please check that your shell actually source
your dircolors:
```
if [ -f ~/.dir_colors/dircolors ]
    then eval `dircolors ~/.dir_colors/dircolors`
fi
```

This should not be necessary on major distributions (such as Ubuntu, Fedora,
etc.) but could be on ArchLinux, Gentoo and others.

Importing iTerm themes
----------------------

It's possible to import an iTerm colorscheme to a gnome-terminal one. Use the
script `tools/import_from_iterm.rb`.

Prerequisites: a working ruby installation with the `nokogiri-plist` ruby gem
(`gem install nokogiri-plist`).

Example call:

`tools/import_from_iterm.rb my_iterm_colorscheme.itermcolors my_iterm_colorscheme`

 Colors
 ------

 Only the foreground, background and highlight colors are different in the light
 and dark color sets, as one of the main ideas behind Ethan Schonoovers work is
 to use the same colors in the palette for both.

 See the [Solarized homepage] for theory behind the colors, screenshots, details
 and colorscheme versions for Vim, Mutt, popular terminal emulators and other
 applications.

Conflicting background colors in VIM
------------------------------------

Use the 16 colors terminal option to get VIM to look like GVIM with solarized
colors.
